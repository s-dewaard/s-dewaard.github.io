# Intro to AI
## Where are we now
AI has come a long way in the past 10 years. In just 2015 the now simple 'is it a bird' model used to determine if images are a bird or not was not possible. 
Now we can run models like this very simpily and quickly thanks to major advances in AI and deep learning. In 2025, we now have models which can not only just recongins patterns in images but produce images based on prompts.

## How can we do this
Using a neural network comprised of various layers all with various filters we can determine specific features in images. Each layer is comprised of filters with more and more detailed elements which are comprised of features from previous layers.
